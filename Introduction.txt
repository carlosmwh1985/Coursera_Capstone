In the last years Leipzig has become a quite attractive and vibrant city in the Sachsen state in Germany. The past of the city and its cultural scene offers many new possibilities. In the city it is nowadays relatively easy to find a quite wide variety of restaurant options, but once one looks closer, it becomes clear that such offers are not so radically different from other metropolis in Germany in particular or in Europe in general.

For such reason it will be quite interesting to explore the possibility to open new restaurants with really new offers, particularly with new cuisine styles, as the one that we are proposing here: A restaurant that gives its customers the possibility to taste the flavors from the Amazonas forest!
